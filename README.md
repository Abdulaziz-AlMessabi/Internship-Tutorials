SOC Internship Tutorials

This repository documents my internship work on building and operating an Educational Security Operations Center (EDU-SOC).  
The tutorials cover everything from network design to deploying security tools like SIEM, EDR, firewalls, and troubleshooting.

These tutorials are written in a **conceptual style** with supporting tables, diagrams, and config snippets to show evidence of hands-on work.  
The purpose of this repository is to serve as my professional portfolio and to help others learn from my experience.
